Just run MAKE.BAT to build the documentation.

Main focus these days is on the .chm file - a single .chm
provides the best documentation solution.


Note: Jan-2008: We seem to have hit a hhc wall.  Trial and error shows
that once at the point shown below, adding a single new '@pymeth' anywhere 
will cause death (a single @pymeth seems to create 4 new 'local links')

The max successful build I got was:

9,609   Topics
30,629  Local links
836     Internet links

I've removed the win32ui module from the autoduck build and we
are now at the figures below - so the problem still appears to
loom...

Compile time: 1 minute, 21 seconds
7,860   Topics
23,712  Local links
830     Internet links

README for building of Scintilla and SciTE


*** GTK+/Linux version ***

You must first have GTK+ 1.2x and GCC (2.8 or better) installed.
GTK+ 1.0x will not work and when it did it was very slow.
Other C++ compilers may work but may require tweaking the make file.

To build SciTE for GTK+/Linux, use the Makefile_gtk like this:

	make -f Makefile_gtk

The current make file only supports static linking between SciTE and Scintilla.

The SciTEGTK.properties file is better than the SciTEGlobal.properties for use 
on Linux/GTK+ as it specifies fonts that are likely to be installed. 
SciTE reads its SciTEGlobal.properties file from the user's home directory.


*** Windows version ***

A C++ compiler is required. Mingw32 GCC 2.9.5 is the compiler used
for most development although Visual C++ is also supported.

To compile with GCC, use make on the "makefile" file.

	make

To compile with VC++, use nmake on the "makefile_vc" file.

	nmake /f makefile_vc

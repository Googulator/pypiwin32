README for building of Scintilla and SciTE

Scintilla can be built by itself.
To build SciTE, Scintilla must first be built.


*** GTK+/Linux version ***

You must first have GTK+ 1.2x and GCC (2.8 or better) installed.
GTK+ 1.0x will not work and when it did it was very slow.
Other C++ compilers may work but may require tweaking the make file.

To build Scintilla, use the makefile located in the scintilla/gtk directory
	cd scintilla/gtk
	make
	cd ../..
	
To build SciTE, use the makefile located in the scite/gtk directory
	cd scite/gtk
	make

Install to /usr/local/bin
	make install

The current make file only supports static linking between SciTE and Scintilla.

The SciTEGTK.properties file is better than the SciTEGlobal.properties for use 
on Linux/GTK+ as it specifies fonts that are likely to be installed. 
SciTE reads its SciTEGlobal.properties file from the user's home directory.


*** Windows version ***

A C++ compiler is required. Mingw32 GCC 2.95.2 is the compiler used
for most development although Visual C++ and Borland C++ are also supported.

The make command used is 
For GCC, make
For VC++, nmake /f makefile_vc
For Borland C++ 5.02 (MAKE Version 5.0), make -l -fmakefile_bor
For Borland C++ Builder, make -fmakefile_bor

To build Scintilla, make in the scintilla/gtk directory
	cd scintilla\win32
	[make command as described above for your compiler]
	cd ..\..
	
To build SciTE, use the makefile located in the scite/gtk directory
	cd scite\win32
	[make command as described above for your compiler]

An executable SciTE will now be in scite\bin.
